        <h1>Abstract</h1><hr>
        <p>
			Cryptocurrencies are systems that allow for the secure payments online which are denominated in terms of virtual "tokens," 
			which are represented by ledger entries internal to the system. 
			"Crypto" refers to the various encryption algorithms and cryptographic techniques that safeguard these entries,
			such as elliptical curve encryption, public-private key pairs, and hashing functions.
			<p></p>
			When cryptocurrency is used to pay for goods or services, each transaction is securely encrypted and
			recorded in a public ledger called a blockchain. The blockchain ensures a cryptocurrency’s integrity
			and eliminates the need for a central administrator, such as a treasury or a central bank. Cryptocurrency
			users connect directly to each other in peer-to-peer transactions, with a degree of anonymity provided by
			the blockchain ledger. A cryptocurrency wallet is used to store various kinds of cryptocurrency.
			<p></p>
			The first decentralized cryptocurrency, bitcoin, was created in 2009 by pseudonymous developer Satoshi Nakamoto.
			It used SHA-256, a cryptographic hash function, as its proof-of-work scheme. In April 2011,
			Namecoin was created as an attempt at forming a decentralized DNS, which would make internet censorship very difficult.
			Soon after, in October 2011, Litecoin was released. It was the first successful cryptocurrency to use scrypt
			as its hash function instead of SHA-256.

        <h1>Our solution</h1><hr>
        <p>
          CryS aims to express and manage the knowledge about existing cryptocurrencies and their meta-data by showing 
			the current value and of each altcoin, price history and the news related to the crypto-market.
		<p></p>	
			Our web application will have the following main functionalities:
			<ul>
				<li>Real time market data about cryptocurrencies</li>
				<li>Cryptocurrency evolution history</li>
				<li>User personalized alerts for coins of interest</li>
				<li>Quick view of favourite user coins</li>
				<li>Latest news regarding coins and market</li>
			</ul>

        <h1>Our proposal</h1><hr>
        <p>
          Our proposal is meant to offer a scalable solution of obtaining and analysing cryptocurrency in real time. Our solution will collect 
		  data from two APIs and by transforming the data into a common format(RDF) it will be able to present to the client the information 
		  exposed by a well documented RESTful API.
        <p></p>
		<br>
          <h1>Architecture</h1><hr>
          <p>
            Our real time stream processing architecture
            is typically made of the following main components:
          </p>
          <figure typeof="sa:Image">
            <img src="./img/module-arhitecture.jpg" width="950" height="700">
            <figcaption style="text-align: center">
              Figure 1. Communication between modules
            </figcaption>
          </figure>
		  <p></p>
          <p>
			Our system collects data from two different APIs:
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://coincap.io/">Coincap</a> - a useful tool for real-time pricing and market activity for over 1,000 cryptocurrencies. 
				By collecting exchange data from thousands of markets, we are able to offer transparent and accurate data on asset price and availability.</li>
				<li><a href="https://cryptocontrol.io/en/developers/apis">CryptoControl</a> - allows users to use a powerful news engine with 
				more than 5,000 articles daily from over 1000+ news sources. 
				It uses a specialized AI to understand context of each article and attribute coins and categories to each article.</li>
			</ul>
		  </p>
		  <p></p>
		  
		  <p>
			After we have the relevant information about cryptocurrencies we transform it into RDF format and we query it for providing 
			the functionalities of our application. 
		  </p>
		  
		  <p>
			We store our tweets data using Apache Jena Fuseki which is a SPARQL server. 
			It provides REST-style SPARQL Query, and SPARQL Update using the SPARQL protocol over HTTP. 
			We use it to store RDF triples and to retrieve information using SPARQL queries.
		  </p>
		  <p></p>
		  
		  <p>
			The client application will be created using Angular in order to expose all functionalities of our solution.
		  </p>
		  <br>
          <h1>REST api</h1><hr>

          <p>
            The UI communicates with the backend via HTTP for the live stream and REST for the information heavy operations, such as the coin meta-data view.<br>
            Such an endpoint converts the Apache Jena format into a UI friendly format, json.
          </p>

          <p>
            Several endoints such as this exist.<br>
            </p><ul>
              <li>
                <b>/coins</b>
                <ul>
                  <li><b>"/"</b> - retrieve info about all coins from the system</li>
                  <li><b>"/{id}"</b> - retrieve details about a cryptocurrency by given id</li>
                  <li><b>"/{id}/history"</b> - retrieve details about history of cryptocurrency</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          <p></p>

          <p>
            The representation of a tweet in json format does not differ much from the one in RDF as can be seen below:
          </p>
